# admin-dashboard
The Admin Dashboard from The Odin Project, with HTML and CSS.

The project is finished! This is by far the most interesting and hardest html and css project I have done. Although there is a deisgn that I am following, but quickly realized is that the ways of achiving the final outcome are infinite.

Many of the HTML elements, and CSS attributes are what I have learned from either The Odin Project's external links of documents like MDN, W3School and CSS Tricks. I am quite satisfied with the final outcome.
